 *  \section intro_sec Inroduction
 *  This documentation describes the different classes of the FLNL client/server library. This library ables to send and receive double values and simple commands between two systems (a client and a server) in a RT fashion (no buffering).<BR>
 *  The library depends on pthread and uses BSD sockets. It can be compiled for Windows and Linux.

# Getting Started with Windows - Installation Instructions

> Note: These instructions are still under development

## Git 
CORC is hosted on Github, and uses Git for its version control. Whilst technically not required (all the files can be downloaded from the Github repository), it is highly recommended that Git is used. 

On Windows, you have the following two options:

- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) - A command-line based utility
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - A GUI specifically for Github Integration 

## Other Tools
It is also useful to have a development environment. If you do not have a preferred environment, VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/) is popular and can be configured with a number of extensions which make development easier. 

## Cross-compilation Tools 
Windows Tools chain for Beaglebone (which uses the arn-linux-gnueabihf) can be downloaded here: https://gnutoolchains.com/beaglebone/. Note that the tested environment is the `bone-debian-9.5-2018-10-07` Image with the `beaglebone-gcc6.3.0-r2.exe` toolchain.

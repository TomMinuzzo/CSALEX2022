# CANOpen Robot Controller (CORC) Project

CORC is a free and open source robotic development software stack, written in C++.

The project was initiated at the University of Melbourne in partnership with Fourier Intelligence, however has welcomed (and continues to welcome) collaborators from all institutions. The project was initially developed to run on an ExoMotus X2 Exoskeleton powered by a Beaglebone Black, however, the software is designed to be extensible to any embedded Linux and CANopen enabled Robotic platform. The repository currently also includes code which has been run on the ArmMotus M1 and M3 rehabilitation devices, and using desktop or laptop Ubuntu installations.

## The CANOpen Robot Controller project includes:

- An extensible framework to represent multibody rigid robotic systems.
- An event driven state machine to develop custom applications (see [here](doc/StateMachine.md)).
- An implementation of [CANopen Socket](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenSocket) to provide an interface between CAN enabled embedded Linux system and CANopen-based motor drivers/sensors.
- [Documentation](https://unimelb-human-robotics-lab.github.io//CANOpenRobotController/index.html)
- Functional application examples.

### Project Overview

The code is structured into 3 levels:

1. **CANopen Communications Level:** Provides the CAN-level communications, providing the mechanisms for the sending and receiving of PDO and SDO messages
2. **The Robot Level:** Defines the components of the Robot to be controlled, including the joints, associated drives, and input devices
3. **The Application Layer:** Defines the high level logic for the device, based on the implementation of a State Machine.

Whilst the code can be modified at any level, this structure is designed to provide a degree of modularity. The CANopen Communications level should not need to be changed. The Robot level should only change with respect if the robot to be controlled changes. This is loosely enforced by the source code folder structure - the files which should not need modification are placed in the `src/core` folder, and the remainder are placed in the `src/apps` and `src/hardware` folders. Note that in addition to the CANopen Communication code, the `src/core` folder also includes base classes which are derived from in the `src/apps` and `src/hardware` folders. 

## Getting started with CORC

The following instructions detail the building and testing of a simple test state machine for the X2 Exoskeleton (ExoTestMachine.cpp). This state machine  simulates a simple exoskeleton which can move between sitting and standing postures, running in position control, triggered by keyboard events. 

At the end of these instructions, you should be to compile and run this example CORC application, verifying that all development tools have been installed correctly. 

### Before you start - Installation Instructions

These instructions assume that you have a suitable test platform (i.e. a Target), and a workbench environment (i.e. a Host). It is suggested that the Target and Host you use for his guide are the platforms you intend to develop on for your own application.

#### Host Installation
The host is your development computer --- generally running a desktop operating system. Instructions for Windows and Linux systems can be found here:

- [Windows Workbench Setup](doc/InstallWindows.md)
- [Linux Workbench Setup](doc/InstallLinux.md)

A previously-used (but not currently recommended) option is to use Docker on a Windows or OSX machine. Some notes on the setup are [here](doc/Docker.md). A final option would be to use a Virtual Machine as your development enviroment. Instructions can be found in Option B [here](https://exoembedded.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workbench/), but this is not currently maintained. 

#### Target Setup
The target chosen will ultimately depend on the specific hardware that you are using. CORC was primarily developed to be run on a Beaglebone Black, thus these instructions primarily focus on a BeagleBone Black running Debian Stretch 9.5 [Firmware](http://beagleboard.org/latest-images). Instructions for setting up the Beaglbone Black can be found on [here](http://beagleboard.org/getting-started) on the Beaglebone Website.

> Note: if you use a Beagle Bone AI see instructions [here](doc/BBAISetup.md) to setup the CAN device.

If you are running a Linux-based machine, and wish to execute your CORC application on that machine, no additional setup is necessary (instructions specific to this setup are tagged with **[DEPLOY-LOCAL]** - generally this will mean that you do not have to complete some steps.).

### How to get the Project

On the host, clone the project from git repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/UniMelb-Human-Robotics-Lab/CANOpenRobotController
```

This repository includes all the sources files required for this example. (If you are running Github Desktop, you can simply clone by using File > Clone Repository...)

### Building ExoTestMachine
CMake is used to generate an appropriate makefile for CORC framework. By default, the generated makefile is configured to compile an executable `ExoTestMachine_APP` using the default C/C++ compilers. To generate a cross-compiled executable (suitable for running on a Beaglebone Black) use the following commands on the host:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../armhf.cmake ..
$ make
```
**[WINDOWS]** If running on Windows, you will also need to add the `-G "Unix Makefiles"` flag to the `cmake` command (i.e. `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../armhf.cmake ..`). This forces the Unix Makefile format, rather than the default `nmake` behaviour on Windows. 

**[DEPLOY-LOCAL]** If you are intending to execute the application on your (Linux) development computer, you can remove the `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../armhf.cmake` alltogether (i.e. just run `cmake ..`). This will use the default C++ compilers on your Linux distribution.

You can alternatively shorten everything to a single line:
```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build/ && cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../armhf.cmake ..
```
> Note that this requires an appropriately configured toolchain (`arm-linux-gnueabihf-` toolchain). See "Before you start" to setup an appropriate workbench if required.

> Note there are also some additional build rules to build additional tests, which are still to be completed (these do not impact the compilation of ExoTestMachine_APP)


### Transferring files to the Linux platform

The recommended method of transferring files to the BeagleBone is FTP.

Using an FTP Client on the Host (if you do not have one - or a preferred client, [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) is reasonable), connect to the target (the BeagleBone). By default, when the BeagleBone is connected to a computer using USB, it is configured to:

- **IP Address:** 192.168.7.2 (Windows) or 192.168.6.2 (OSX and Linux)
- **Username:** debian
- **Password:** temppwd

On the host, using the FTP client, transfer the build executable in `build/ExoTestMachine_APP`, along with the contents of the `initRobot` folder, to the Beaglebone.

Alternatively, you can use the [script/uploadBB.sh](script/uploadBB.sh) to automatically upload the content of the script folder and the build/\*APP to the BeagleBone through ssh. 

> Note: The `initRobot` folder contains scripts for setting up the CAN interfaces that CORC uses for communication

In addition, copy the `config` folder to the same directory as the executable - this is used to set some parameters in the X2Robot. 

**[DEPLOY-LOCAL]** This entire step is not required if you are running on your development machine - just note the location of your `ExoTestMachine_APP` and `initRobot` folder. 

## Run Virtual ExoTestMachine

### Connect to the Target and Modify Run Permissions
To run the ExoTestMachine, open your preferred terminal window and SSH into the the BeagleBone. This will provide terminal access to the target, on the host. This can be done using the same username and password, e.g:

```bash
$ ssh debian@192.168.7.2
```

At this point, you will need to change the permissions of the executables to allow execution. You can do this using the the `chmod +x` command on the target. e.g.

```bash
$ chmod +x ExoTestMachine_APP
```

This must be repeated for the `.sh` scripts as well.

**[DEPLOY-LOCAL]**  If you are deploying to a local machine, these steps are not required are not required, you will just need to open a terminal window for the next steps.

### Initialise Virtual CAN Device
The CORC Application requires the a CAN device to send commands to. For this test, we create a virtual CAN device (so no hardware is required). To do this, initialise the Virtual CAN device to set up, bind to and run candump ([candump manpage](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/can-utils/candump.1.en.html)) on the VCAN interface using the `initVCAN` script. 

```bash
$  cd initRobot
$  ./initVCAN.sh
```
This initialises a virtual CAN interface, and prints the contents of the bus to the terminal window.

> Note: This can be changed to use a non-virtual CAN interface, but this requires some minor changes to the code before compilation, and the use of the `X2_startCAN.sh` script instead.

SSH into the BeagleBone in a second terminal window (**[DEPLOY-LOCAL]** or launch a second terminal) to launch the application:

```bash
$  cd build
$  sudo ./ExoTestMachine_APP
```

> Note: Superuser privileges (`sudo`) are required due to the use of real time threads in the application.

The first terminal one should display CAN messages on VCAN from the `EXOTestMachine_APP` application output. On startup init PDO messaging should be sent and appear as follows:
​

```bash
vcan0 704 [1] 00
vcan0 184 [2] 00 00 # PDO message
vcan0 704 [1] 05
```

​
Follow terminal instructions using your keyboard in the second terminal instance to run through test stateMachine.​

```bash
==================================
 WELCOME TO THE TEST STATE MACHINE
==================================
==================================
 PRESS S to start program
==================================
​
```

The first terminal instance (running candump) should display PDO messages corresponding to changes to the commanded motor positions as follows:

```bash
vcan0  301   [8]  2F 60 60 00 00 00 00 00
vcan0  302   [8]  80 60 60 00 00 00 00 00
vcan0  303   [8]  2F 60 60 00 00 00 00 00
vcan0  304   [8]  80 60 60 00 00 00 00 00
```

> Note these TPDO messages are configured in the Object Dictionary, with configuration SDOs to be sent during the Robot Initialisation stage. Details for the default set of PDOs can be found in the drive.h source files.

As the simulated device is in position control, these messages should print whenever the system moves from sit to stand or stand to sit, with no messages transmitted whilst the device is stationary (except for the SYNC messages of the format `vcan0 080 [0]`). CORC has provisions for velocity and torque control, but these are not included in this example for ease of simulation.

If these messages are present, this indicates that the workbench and CORC toolbox have been installed successfully. You can close the program by pressing `ctrl+c`.
